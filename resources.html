                            <td>A: It varies by behavior, but typically, we recommend a minimum of 4â€“6 months. The client only moves to the next Scaling Ladder (Phase 11) after 30 days of 100% consistency with the previous phase.</td>

                            <td>A: Pushing too hard, too fast. They violate the Zero-Motivation Rule (Phase 3) by increasing the difficulty before the foundation is cemented. The system is about small, consistent wins.</td>

                <ul class="check-list">
                    <li><strong>Establish Your Niche:</strong> Use your Identity Shift (Phase 1) to define who you are as a coach. (Example: I am a system designer for professionals struggling with work-life balance).</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Structure:</strong> Register your business (Sole Proprietor, LLC, etc.) and obtain liability insurance. Consult with a local legal expert.</li>
                    <li><strong>Client Agreement:</strong> Develop a clear coaching agreement/contract that defines confidentiality, payment terms, and the non-therapeutic nature of coaching.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Platform:</strong> Choose a secure platform for client data and video sessions (e.g., Google Workspace, dedicated HIPAA-compliant tools if in healthcare).</li>
                    <li><strong>Boundary Setting:</strong> Define your Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) (Phase 6) for client communication (e.g., only respond to emails during designated Admin Blocks).</li>

If a client expresses immediate intent to harm themselves or others, or is in an acute crisis, the coach **must immediately** cease coaching and refer the client to emergency services using the appropriate local number.
